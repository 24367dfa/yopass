# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in this project, please report via email at johan{a}haals.se and do not create a public issue to prevent abuse.

There are a couple of things that I do not consider to be security issues:

- Enumeration/Gusessing of UUIDs or decryption keys
- URLs being stored in browser history/cache
- Vulnerabilities in build time dependencies not exploitable at runtime
